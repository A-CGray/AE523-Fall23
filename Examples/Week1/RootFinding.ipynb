Both are vectors of length $N$ (or in math-speak $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$) and we are looking for the values of $\\mathbf{u}$ that make all the entries in $\\mathbf{r}$ zero. A good example might be a CFD solver, where the state is the vector of the velocities/pressures/temperatures in all the cells, and the residual is a measure of the error in the discretised flow equations in each cell.\n",
    "2. $\\mathbf{dr/du}$ is now an $N \\times N$ matrix ($\\mathbf{dr/du} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$) and we can't divide by a matrix. So the equation for updating the state becomes $\\mathbf{u_{i+1}} = \\mathbf{u_i} - \\mathbf{dr/du}^{-1}\\mathbf{r(u_i)}$ [^ref]\n",
    "3. Since we are now dealing with multiple values that we want all to be (close to) zero, we need a way to measure how close we are to the root. We can do this using the norm of the residual vector, different types of vector norms are covered in section 1.3 of the course notes\n",
