    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to get a working python installation on your computer, depending on whether you're using Windows, Mac, or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first option is to install standard python, which you can download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is to install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/), which comes with a bunch of extra packages and tools that can be useful for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I don't use Anaconda as I prefer to have more control over what I install, but both options are popular.\n",

    "## Installing an IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE is basically a text editor combined with some additional tools that allow you to run and debug your code.\n",
    "My IDE of choice is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "Two other popular IDEs are [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), both of these are more specifically designed for python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Whatever IDE you choose, make sure you learn how to use it's python debugger.\n",
    "A debugger will allow you to pause the program at a specific point and then step through the code line by line and inspect the values of variables.\n",
    "Debugging this way is much more efficient than using print statements.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "You should also learn to use some of the keyboard shortcuts for your IDE.\n",
    "Different IDEs have different shortcuts that will make your editing experience easier by allowing you to quickly do things like rename a variable everywhere it appears in your code, comment and uncomment large blocks of code, and create multiple cursors to edit multiple lines at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "VSCode has some walkthroughs of these features that should show up the first time you open it.\n",
